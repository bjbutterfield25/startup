### How the Internet Works
Each device has its own IP address (numbers) that is public. Our devices are connected to an ISP (internet service provider). 

Communication layers

| Layer | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application | HTTPS | Functionality like web browsing |
| Transport | TCP/UDP | Packet delivery |
| Internet | IP | Establishing connectioins, routing |
| Link | Fiber, hardware | Physical connections |

### Domain Name System
It maps human readable names to their IP addresses. Localhost is the DNS for your device. 



## HTML Notes

How to deploy files:
./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s startup

HTML is the structural language of the web
- <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser that it is a html file

- <div>: a block division of content
- <span>: an inline span of content
- <h[1-9]>: Text heading from 1-9
- <table>: table
- <ol, ul>: ordered or unordered list
- <a>: anchor the text to a hyperlink

## CSS Notes

CSS is used to style websites. Order is important! It will apply whatever was declared last.

You can include CSS inline, using the style element or by referencing a stylesheet
Inline ex: style = "color:red; font-size: 50vh"
Ref ex: link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"

Use MDN to learn CSS.
Use dev tools in the browser to debug CSS.
