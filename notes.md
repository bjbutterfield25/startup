### How the Internet Works
Each device has its own IP address (numbers) that is public. Our devices are connected to an ISP (internet service provider). 

Communication layers

| Transport | TCP/UDP | Packet delivery |
| Internet | IP | Establishing connectioins, routing |
| Link | Fiber, hardware | Physical connections |

### Domain Name System
It maps human readable names to their IP addresses. Localhost is the DNS for your device.
